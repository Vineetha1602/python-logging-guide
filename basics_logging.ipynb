        "The difference between setting a level for a logger and setting a level for a file handler is in how logging messages are filtered and processed before being written to a log file:\n",

        "\n",
        "✅ Handler level further filters messages before they are written to a log file.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ You can have multiple handlers with different levels (e.g., console logs all messages, file only logs warnings/errors).\n",

        "***Important*** \n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Every time you run this script, it adds a new handler, leading to duplicate log entries. Solution: Before adding a handler, check if one already exists.\n",
